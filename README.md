•	A project to provide myself with the opportunity to practice and be familiar with OpenCV library and C++.

•	Identifies square shapes in images through an algorithm that detects contours that fit the constraint of having approximately 90 degrees on four corners. 

•	Calculates the width, height and centroid location of square shapes detected in the input images.
